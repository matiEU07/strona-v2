    <center><h1>Tōyō Rapid 1000 series</h1>
    <h3>everything i know</h3>
<br><br><br>

    since <i>a lot</i> of documentation of the tōyō rapid 1000 series is only in japanese, i decided to compile some knowledge in english.
<br><br>
    So, Tōyō Rapid 1000 series was an electric multiple unit, and were in 10-car sets. <br>
    They consisted of eight motored cars ("M") and two trailer cars ("T") at the both ends.<br><br>
        <img src="toyo/toyorapid1000.webp" width="95%" class="shadow"><br><br><br>
        As you probably noticed, the car formation is unchanged from Tokyo metro 5000 series,<br>
        but the vehicle numbering is. Now, intead of numbers being assigned based on the equipment and order of manufacture,<br>
        they were based on the vehicle's coupling position.
        <br><br>
        <div class="hoverToyoFront"></div> 
        <br>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Controls</h3>
        <br> i still have to model them, but they were unchanged from the tokyo metro 5000 series, aside from getting rid of the jr safety devices <br><br><br><br><br>
